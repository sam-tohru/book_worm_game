# book_worm_game
A short top-down shooter game, I made in less than 5 days for a game-jam
made with godot 4.0.3

cand be played online on itch at: https://kobemano.itch.io/book-worm

this game is a bit of a mess, for some reason the physics are all wonky, like I was trying to implement this feature where the player gets a boost, goes all rigid and bounces around, however this messes up the physics big time, causes the player to bounce too fast, getting out of the map
I ran out of time during this game-jam to fix this major issue, i did all i could within the time to minimize it (smaller & more planned out maps & enemies) but the physics can still be a little bit wonky.
probably try one of my other games for a leff-buggy experience

But this was my first delve into making cutscenes in a game as well as making music (with bosca ceoil)
